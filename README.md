## Pandemic Rim: A Shooter
This is a shooter. Even a clicker! You can choose among those and then play. 
Use the WASD keys to move the cannon, and then click to shoot. You have to shoot the Coronaviruses and gather coins and bottles of sanitizers.
If you are in the clicker, you have to click on the virus, in order to earn more coins!
Enjoy!
